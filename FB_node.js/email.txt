The App Password is used in Nodemailer

ChatGpt:
The error message indicates that the login attempt to the SMTP server was rejected because it requires an application-specific password. This usually happens when you have enabled two-factor authentication (2FA) for your Gmail account.

To resolve this issue, you need to generate an application-specific password for your Gmail account and use it in your Node.js application instead of your regular Gmail password.

Here's how you can generate an application-specific password:

1. Go to your Google Account settings page.
2. Navigate to the "Security" section.
3. Under "Signing in to Google", select "App passwords".
4. Sign in again if prompted.
5. Choose the app and device you want to generate the app password for.

Follow the instructions to generate and use the app password.
Once you have generated the application-specific password, replace your regular Gmail password with the newly generated app password in your Node.js application.

After making these changes, try sending the email again, and it should work without any authentication errors.
